# DSA Visualizer Project

Welcome to the DSA Visualizer Project! This interactive tool aims to enhance your understanding of various data structures and algorithms through dynamic visual representations. It provides a hands-on learning experience for students, enthusiasts, and anyone looking to explore the world of data structures and algorithms.

## Features

- Visualize key data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- Observe how algorithms like sorting, searching, and traversals work on different datasets.
- Interactive controls to step through algorithm execution, and adjust visualization speed.
- Easy-to-use interface for an intuitive learning experience.
